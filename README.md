This is an Arduino and HTML based game working with the concept of serial communication.
Shoot enemies on screen by pointing at them with a physical gun outside the screen giving a more feel to the experience to the game. Press the trigger on the gun to shoot enemies.
Dodge enemy fire by actually dodging from the sensors on the computer, engaging yourself more into the game.
Time your shots right! Welcome to Block Buster.


The game uses an Arduino micro hooked to an ultrasonic sensor which detects the gun being front of the screen or not. The presence of the gun in front of the sensor determines if the player is dodging or not.
The gun is also connected to the microcontroller and has a momentary switch built into it in the form of a trigger. Pressing the trigger enables you to fire at the enemy.
